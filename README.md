# Rest

This is very simple pet-project to understand working of RESTful services.

Here you can see application that only shows Hello World or Hello {Entered name}

### How to run and what to do next

To run application you need just to pull it and run RestApplication.java

After that you can use any browser and enter http://localhost:8080/greeting to see json representation of Greeting 
record that have in itself id and name of user(or, by default, "World").

To enter custom name you need to use, for example '?name=John', so your url will have that view:
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=John
